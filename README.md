# nanopad2-bitwig
Bitwig controller script for [Korg nanoPAD2](http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/nanopad2/).

This script lets you use the nanoPAD2 to launch clips.  It supports 8 tracks
and 8 scenes per track.

The top row of the nanoPAD2 corresponds to track 1 in Bitwig, with each
pad in the row corresponding to a scene in Bitwig's clip launcher.

Use the scene buttons on the nanoPAD2 to navigate from track 1 and 2 (scene 1
on the nano) to tracks 3 and 4 (scene 2) and so on.

To install, copy the "Factotumo" folder and contents to Bitwig's contoller
scripts directory.

On OS X this is *~/Documents/Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts*.
