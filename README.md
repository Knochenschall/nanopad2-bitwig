Bitwig controller script for Korg nanoPAD2.

To install copy the "Factotumo" folder and contents to Bitwig's contoller
scripts directory.  On OS X this is

More on installation at:

    *(https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/control_scripts/installation_guide)*

This script lets you use the nanoPAD2 to launch clips.  It supports 8 tracks
and 8 scenes per track.

The top row of the nanoPAD2 corresponds to track 1 in Bitwig, with each
pad in the row corresponding to a scene.

Using the scene buttons on the nanoPAD2 you can navigate from track 1 and 2
to tracks 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8.
